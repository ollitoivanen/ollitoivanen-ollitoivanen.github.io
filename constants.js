  "Hello, I'm Olli, a long time software developer and a second year software engineering student. I've been building my own apps and websites since 2017 and have gathered solid experience with managing projects from start to deployment. My strengths include building Full-Stack apps with React and React Native, designing intuitive user interfaces and efficiently turning ideas into usable products.";

export const ABOUT_ME_PARAGRAPH_2 =
  " My journey started when I discoverd a problem as a footballer that I wanted to solve. Playing competetively meant that I wanted to train on my own time. However, there wasn't a way to know if there was any space on the field to train. So I started building an app to solve this, first with Java, then with React Native. With no background to software engineering the learning curve felt impossibly deep but with patience and lots of googling, I learned everything needed to build an app with authentication, a database and user interaction.";
export const ABOUT_ME_PARAGRAPH_3 =
  "In the following years football became more of an hobby and I started taking software engineering even more seriously. I kept solving small inconveniences in my daily life with software, discovering new technologies and methodologies.  In 2021 I started my studies at University of Turku, studying Information Technology. Here I have met many like-minded friends to study and improve with.  Now my days consist of coding, studying and running. I also have a great interest in hiking, cycling and photography.";
